# Gravity Calculator

This program is written in the Hmmm assembly language and is used to calculate the final position of an object under the influence of gravity. The program takes three inputs: the falling time, initial position, and initial velocity. The output of the program is the final position of the object.

## Introduction

In this program, the gravitational constant is assumed to be -10, representing the acceleration due to gravity. The program uses this constant along with the falling time, initial position, and initial velocity to calculate the final position of the object.

## Hmmm Assembly Language

Hmmm is a simple assembly language designed for educational purposes. It is used to introduce students to the concepts of low-level programming and computer architecture. The Hmmm language consists of a set of instructions that can be executed by the Hmmm virtual machine.

## Program Execution

To run the Gravity Calculator program, follow these steps:

1. Load the Hmmm virtual machine or simulator.
2. Load the Gravity Calculator program into the virtual machine.
3. Set the initial values of falling time, initial position, and initial velocity in the program.
4. Execute the program.
5. The final position of the object will be displayed as the output.

## Program Flow

The Gravity Calculator program follows the following steps to calculate the final position:

1. Read the falling time, initial position, and initial velocity from the input.
2. Calculate the gravitational force by multiplying the falling time by the square of the gravitational constant.
3. Calculate the change in position due to gravity by multiplying half of the gravitational force by the square of the falling time.
4. Add the initial position and the change in position to get the final position.
5. Display the final position as the output.
